# PDF RAG ChatBot

## Description:
This project combines the power of LangChain, ChromaDB, and Hugging Face's large language models to create an intelligent chatbot capable of answering a wide range of user queries. The chatbot leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to overcome the limitations of traditional Language Model (LLM) based queries. It retrieves information from a knowledge base stored in ChromaDB and uses LLMs to summarize documents into concise and informative responses.
